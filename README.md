# Antidote Electronics Orbiter Trackball Prototype

This Unity Demo project is used to showcase the functionality of the Antidote Electronics Orbiter Trackball prototype.

The Arduino orientation is communicated as a Quaternion over a BLE signal, which is recieved through the COM port. 
Unity then translates that information to represent the physical objects orientation.
